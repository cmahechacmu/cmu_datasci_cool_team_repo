This data set was obtained from the COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University. The data sources used to build this data set include the World Health Organization (WHO), the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), different US data sources per the state (eg. the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment).
